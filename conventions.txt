Buildat conventions
===================
Coding style
------------
Look at the code. It is perfect and will be kept perfect. Requests to fix coding
style are not to be taken personally by the one requesting, nor the one being
requested to fix his style.

The script (requires an unix shell and astyle):
Always run util/codestyle.sh before committing. It handles most whitespace
issues.

Identifiers:
- Class and struct names are CamelCase,
- All function names are lowercase_with_underscores,
- All variable names are lowercase_with_underscores,
- All member variables start with m_.

Never use "class", always use "struct".

Non-exception throwing and exception-throwing methods
-----------------------------------------------------
- get_x: Returns NULL or equivalent if not found
- check_x: Throws exception if not found

Directory structure
-------------------
├── 3rdparty    << Bundled 3rd-party libraries
├── build       << Build files; always mkdir build; cmake .. to keep things clean
├── cache       << Runtime directory used by Buildat
├── share       << Static files; installable in /usr/share/buildat
│   └── builtin << Built-in modules
├── src
│   ├── client  << Client-specific code
│   ├── core    << Core code (must be kept minimal but sufficient)
│   ├── impl    << Interface implementations
│   ├── interface << Interface available to modules
│   └── server  << Server-specific code
├── test        << All kinds of stuff for testing
└── util        << Miscellaneous development utilities

Commit messages
---------------
In present tense. Prepend a location to the message where possible. When adding
something, the "add" verb should be left out. Fine enough examples:
- interface::Server::check_module
- doc: conventions.txt, todo.txt
- Bind a socket but don't listen to it yet
- Remove Module::test_add
- client, 3rdparty/c55lib: Command-line parameters
- 3rdparty/cereal
