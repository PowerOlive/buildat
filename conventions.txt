Buildat conventions
===================
C++ Coding style
----------------
Look at the code. It is perfect and will be kept perfect. Requests to fix coding
style are not to be taken personally by the one requesting, nor the one being
requested to fix his style. If something is found to be missing from this
document, such additions shall be made.

util/codestyle.sh:
Always run util/codestyle.sh before committing. It handles most whitespace
issues.

Identifiers:
- Class and struct names are CamelCase,
- All function names are lowercase_with_underscores,
- All variable names are lowercase_with_underscores,
- All member variables start with m_. If the struct in question is a stupid data
  container, this does not need to be followed.

Never use "class", always use "struct".

Prefer lightweight interfaces with a creation function for the default
implementation, like "struct State" and "State* createState()". The default
implementation can be called "CState" in this case, if an obviously better name
does not exist.

Use std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr. (core/types.h: up_<> and sp_<>)

Header files must have zero preprocessor conditionals.

Function naming:
- Suffix _u: Unsafe, not included in public interface

Do not use assert(); throw anonymous exceptions instead:
- if(fail) throw Exception("Thing failed");

Naming:
- "type": Numeric id representing a type
- "name": A string; generally works as an identifier but not necessarily
- "id":   Numeric id of an instance of something that is not a type

Logging:
- Use core/log.h. Only use stdout directly in case of an interactive command
  line interface (like printing errors for command line arguments).

Ordering of #include directives:
1) The interface that the current file implements, ""
2) Internal interfaces, from core-ish to utility-ish, ""
3) Bundled libraries, <>
4) Installed libraries, <>
5) STL headers, <>
6) System headers, <>

Non-exception throwing and exception-throwing methods
-----------------------------------------------------
- get_x: Returns NULL or equivalent if not found
- check_x: Throws exception if not found

Commit messages
---------------
In present tense. Prepend a location to the message where possible. When adding
something, the "add" verb should be left out. Fine enough examples:
- interface::Server::check_module
- doc: conventions.txt, todo.txt
- Bind a socket but don't listen to it yet
- Remove Module::test_add
- client, 3rdparty/c55lib: Command-line parameters
- 3rdparty/cereal
