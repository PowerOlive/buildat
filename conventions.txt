Buildat conventions
===================
Coding style
------------
Look at the code. It is perfect and will be kept perfect. Requests to fix coding
style are not to be taken personally by the one requesting, nor the one being
requested to fix his style.

Non-exception throwing and exception-throwing methods
-----------------------------------------------------
- get_x: Returns NULL or equivalent if not found
- check_x: Throws exception if not found
