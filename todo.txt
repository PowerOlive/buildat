Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Use portable binary archives for networked data

Buildat TODO later
==================
- Watch dependencies of module source and client_lua/*.lua in addition to main file
