Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be unloadable if possible. Figure out if so, and how to handle
  references to modules when unloading them.
- There should be some kind of an easy synchronous calling mechanism between
  modules.
- Modules should be run in threads.
