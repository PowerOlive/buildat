Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be unloadable if possible. Figure out if so, and how to handle
  references to modules when unloading them.
- There should be some kind of an easy synchronous calling mechanism between
  modules.
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Network should leave socket fds in m_server when destructing, and pick them up
  on core:continue.
- Move module/include/api.h to module/api.h

Buildat TODO later
==================
- Watch dependencies of module source and client_lua/*.lua in addition to main file
