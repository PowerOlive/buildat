Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Implement module depencencies in test/testmodules/__loader
- There should probably be a builtin/loader that __loader usually wants to call
- A good Lua interface for (de)serializing objects to/from cereal binary
  archives
- CMakeLists.txt: Add a way of building only the server, without polycode
  dependency
