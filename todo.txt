Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Network should leave socket fds in m_server when destructing, and pick them up
  on core:continue.
- builtin/client_file should somehow not forget its file list at reload

Buildat TODO later
==================
- Watch dependencies of module source and client_lua/*.lua in addition to main file
