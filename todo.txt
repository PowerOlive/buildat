Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Implement module depencencies in test/testmodules/__loader
- There should probably be a builtin/loader that __loader usually wants to call
- __menu extension support (load when no server address is provided)
- Ask hmmmm/kwolekr for permission to use MT's noise under the Apache 2.0
  license and if allowed, include it in interfaces
- Design how to manage scenes in a future-proof way
- Implement easy Lua scripting on the server (Luabind or not? The purpose is to
  allow recycling the same Lua code on the client and the server, which means
  that Lua will dictate the function/object design)
- Move self-contained library-like Lua functions from client/app.cpp to a
  reusable location so that they can be used from server-side Lua in the future
- util/codestyle.sh: Add some CMakeLists.txt formatting (case, whitespace)
- Proper whitelisting sandbox for Urho3D's Lua API
