Buildat
=======
A Minecraft clone with vast extendability.

Client
------
Built using Polycode C++.

Module code is transfered from the server and run in a safe Lua sandbox.

Server
------
Built using C++ with most functionality in RCC++.

C++ modules can interface with each other by using Cereal.

Modules cannot be unloaded at runtime. Module unload and reload can be simulated
by restarting the server and clients automatically while keeping connections
open.

Module structure
----------------
module
|-- client
|   `-- init.lua
|-- server
|   `-- init.cpp
`-- data
    `-- media.png

Module behavior
---------------
All client scripts are automatically sent to the client. Everything else is
handled by the module implementation.
