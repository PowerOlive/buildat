Reasons for not doing certain things
====================================
Why not use protobuf?
- It would suck for modules because it has many moving parts

Why not detect -DURHO3D_64BIT automatically in the build system?
- It's not possible

Why not use cereal's versioning system?
- It doesn't support forward compatibility

Why not allow making arbitrary number of instances of any module?
- It would make module reloading and management practically impossible, and it
  would make module interoperability much harder to achieve. Creating a robust
  but usable system for threading is also tricky. Also, it does not make that
  much sense to run multiple worlds in a single server process because then all
  would crash if one crashes.
- Instead there should be easy mechanisms for launching new server processes at
  runtime, and routing clients to different processes.
