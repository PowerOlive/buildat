Reasons for not doing certain things
====================================
Why not use protobuf?
- It would suck for modules because it has many moving parts

Why not detect -DURHO3D_64BIT automatically in the build system?
- It's not possible

Why not use cereal's versioning system?
- It doesn't support forward compatibility
