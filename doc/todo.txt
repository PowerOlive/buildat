Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Implement module depencencies in test/testmodules/__loader
- There should probably be a builtin/loader that __loader usually wants to call
- __menu extension support (load when no server address is provided)
	- Add a parameter to the client for choosing a boot-up extension, which
	  implements a boot() function that will be called
- Ask hmmmm/kwolekr for permission to use MT's noise under the Apache 2.0
  license and if allowed, include it in interfaces
- Design how to manage scenes in a future-proof way
- Implement easy Lua scripting on the server (Luabind or not? The purpose is to
  allow recycling the same Lua code on the client and the server, which means
  that Lua will dictate the function/object design)
- Move self-contained library-like Lua functions from client/app.cpp to a
  reusable location so that they can be used from server-side Lua in the future
- Update testmodules/minigame to urho3d
- New things in deps.txt?
	- disable_module
	- override_module (in such a way that the module will be gotten from the
	  server with it's original name, and with the name of the overridden
	  module. The overridden module will still be loaded and be available to the
	  overriding module in some way.)
- Doxygen for the C++ interfaces
- Copy compiler flags (at least -m32/64 and stuff like -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG) from
  CMake to RCC++
- Voxel world with arbitrary chunk size and offset, with pluggable loader
  modules. Main world has worldspace_id=1. Try Polyvox.
- Support Cereal's shared pointer serialization in Lua
- An extension that provides configuration options that both the main menu and
  games can open
