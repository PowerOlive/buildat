Buildat TODO
============
- Cache a hash of each compiled module in order not to rebuild them
  unnecessarily
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Include hmmmm/kwolekr's MT noise under interfaces (Simplified BSD)
- Design how to manage scenes in a future-proof way
- Implement easy Lua scripting on the server
	- Allow creating Lua modules on the server, for those who don't like C++
	- Allow recycling the same Lua code on the client and the server
- Move self-contained library-like Lua functions from client/app.cpp to a
  reusable location so that they can be used from server-side Lua in the future
- New things in meta.txt?
	- disable_module
	- override_module (in such a way that the module will be gotten from the
	  server with it's original name, and with the name of the overridden
	  module. The overridden module will still be loaded and be available to the
	  overriding module in some way.)
- Doxygen for the C++ interfaces
- Copy compiler flags (at least -m32/64 and stuff like -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG) from
  CMake to RCC++
- Voxel world with arbitrary chunk size and offset, with pluggable loader
  modules. Main world has worldspace_id=1. Try Polyvox.
	- Normal block size should be definable to be a multiple of the voxel size
		- "Continuation voxels"
- Support Cereal's shared pointer serialization in Lua
- Something in uistack's global nil focus handling has broken
- Automatically fetch and build and patch Urho3D when building buildat
- Handle module load order properly in reloads (unload by popping from top,
  then reload everything until top)
- Move path safety checking from buildat_guard to BuildatResourceRouter
