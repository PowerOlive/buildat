Buildat TODO
============
- Modules should be run in threads.
- Include hmmmm/kwolekr's MT noise under interfaces (Simplified BSD)
- Design how to manage scenes in a future-proof way
- Implement easy Lua scripting on the server
	- Allow creating Lua modules on the server, for those who don't like C++
	- Allow recycling the same Lua code on the client and the server
- Move self-contained library-like Lua functions from client/app.cpp to a
  reusable location so that they can be used from server-side Lua in the future
- New things in meta.json?
	- disable_module
	- override_module (in such a way that the module will be gotten from the
	  server with it's original name, and with the name of the overridden
	  module. The overridden module will still be loaded and be available to the
	  overriding module in some way.)
- Doxygen for the C++ interfaces
- Copy compiler flags (at least -m32/64 and stuff like -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG) from
  CMake to RCC++
- Voxel world with arbitrary chunk size and offset, with pluggable loader
  modules. Main world has worldspace_id=1. Try Polyvox.
	- Normal block size should be definable to be a multiple of the voxel size
		- "Continuation voxels"
- Support Cereal's shared pointer serialization in Lua
- Automatically fetch and build and patch Urho3D when building buildat
- Automatic buildat root detection so that the server and the client can
  generally be started with any working directory in either the in-source or
  windows-installed configuration
- Precompiled mode
- Singleplayer UI
- Show all exceptions and errors on client using ui_utils.show_message_dialog
- Pass the replicated scene properly to Lua
- Allow creating and destroying arbitrary amounts of replicated scenes
- Switch to using #define MODULE in modules, and rename Module::MODULE
- magic.sub_sync_node_added -> replicate.sub_sync_node_added
- Use tags for module dependencies (tags, require_tag, disallow_tag), and
  auto-tag each module at runtime with game_<current_game>
- Threaded mesh generation
- If an error occurs on the client in module initialization, show error and quit
- Show sandbox_test status at corner and don't show dialog unless something is
  found
- Local split-screen multiplayer: Two options:
	- One Urho3D instance with systems in place to manage two UIs and things in
	  the same instance (may be impossible)
	- Allow connecting the input systems of multiple windows, which is simple
	  but less automatic and most people don't know how to get rid of window
	  borders
- Maintain a global budget of background processing per frame so that a long
  woxelworld:update and ThreadPool::run_post() will not be run on the same frame
	- Pre (lod) geometry can take up to 2500us, and post can take 7200us, which
	  means this will have a visible effect.
- Multiple replicated scens and voxelworlds, with threading, for servers with a
  lobby and multiple worlds
- Don't emit all world generation events at once
- Handle module load order properly in reloads (unload by popping from top,
  then reload everything until top)
	- When reloading a module, unload all dependants first; then load dependants
	  again
	- Each module should be able to choose whether they want their dependants
	  unloaded or not; eg. network can just store the socket fds and be reloaded
	  without anyone noticing
		- Altough, network is very rarely modified so it doesn't really matter
- Rename VoxelInstance::getId() to VoxelInstance::get_id()
- A way of figuring out which voxel is being pointed at
- Get rid of the dual module reload when saving a C++ file in Vim
