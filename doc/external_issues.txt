Issues in other projects affecting Buildat
==========================================

Urho3D:
- It is not possible to implement any kind of custom loading functionality into
  Urho3D::ResourceCache. It is not inheritable, and it does not provide any way
  to insert custom loaders in other ways. The only thing we can currently do is
  wrap GetResource in Lua, and copy the files into a temporary file structure
  before calling the actual GetResource.
