Buildat: Most important performance issues
==========================================

Issues are ordered by descending importance.

1. Applying the physics box generation result for 32x32x32 voxels into the
physics world is too slow. It is currently split to only two parts; the creation
of the Urho3D::CollisionShapes and constructing the physics stuff in Bullet.
Both can take up to 20us in worst practical case, and cannot be threaded.

This can probably be fixed by splitting the resulting CollisionShapes into
multiple child nodes (assuming the physics system handles that appropriately).

2. Creating the CustomGeometry for a 32x32x32 node is too slow. It can take up
to 5000us in the worst practical case and cannot be threaded. It likely cannot
be split into multiple steps (measuring needed).

It is definitely solvable by splitting the node to multiple subvolumes and
creating child nodes out of them.

It might not be worth solving because the time is relatively low.
